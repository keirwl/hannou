One might be shocked at how many steps it takes to simply share an image between my iPhone, Windows and Linux computers. I realised the quickest way would be to simply copy to and paste from a webpage. Naturally, I then thought it'd be good to be able to tag and search for images, crop and resize, and so on.
The name 反応 was chosen as my primary use for a tagged image database isn't, say, finding photos from my Istanbul holiday that contain a cat, but rather finding the ideal picture of an annoyed Akaza Akari to use as a reaction image in online discussions.
