One might be shocked at how many steps it takes to simply share an image between my iPhone, Windows and Linux computers. I realised the quickest way would be to simply copy to and paste from a webpage. Naturally, I then thought it'd be good to be able to tag and search for images, crop and resize, and so on. "So you're making a booru?" a friend asked. Yes, I suppose I am.
The name 反応 was chosen as my primary use for a tagged image database isn't, say, finding photos from my Istanbul holiday that contain a cat, but rather finding the ideal picture of an annoyed Akaza Akari to use as a reaction image in online discussions.

As of 2025-03-22 basic functionality is complete but there's still a lot to be done to make this nicer to use, including:
* thumbnailing images
* handling conversion of images to png for clipboard on the backend
* allowing download of images, converted to any desired type
* select tags from a dropdown, possibly with counts
* stats/utility page

And many things to make the code nicer, including:
* properly restful backend
* documented api response format, frontend types that respect it
* error handling for image update/deletion
* debouncing the search input

Those might come with a complete change of the frontend and backend frameworks as I experiment with different technologies.
